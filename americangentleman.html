        <div class="title">The Sunday Hangover Cure</div>
        <div class="body"><p>Face it, you had a long week. Work, meetings, presentations, probably a couple happy hours. Then you had a big weekend, cut loose, threw back a few too many cold beers. Now it&#8217;s Sunday, your eyes are bloodshot, your body feels like you fell down a flight of stairs (theres a likelihood that you may have), you need a cure. We feel your pain (quite literally). So every Sunday AG will bring you a new hang-over cure for you to try. This week&#8217;s is&#8230;</p>
<p>The Perfect Bloody Mary:</p>
<p>2 oz Absolute Peppar (of if you&#8217;re really adventurous try Bakon Vodka <a href="http://bakonvodka.com/" target="_blank"><a href="http://bakonvodka.com/" target="_blank">http://bakonvodka.com/</a></a>)<br/> 10 oz of Zing Zang Bloody Mary Mix<br/> A dash of Tabasco and Worcestershire<br/> Celery Salt<br/> Fresh Ground Black Pepper <br/> Garnish with two olives, a lime and a celery stick</p>
<p>Shake and enjoy. </p>
<p>How it works: </p>
<p>While your body is dealing with the new (and delicious) alcohol, it is ignoring the copious amounts of liquor still in your system. Meanwhile the Zing Zang and garnish are full of vitamins to help replenish your body. So enjoy a little &#8220;hair of the dog that bit you.&#8221;</p></div>

        <div class="title">Fall Essentials: The Tweed Blazer</div>
        <div class="body"><p>Esquire declares this blazer to be the quintessential fall piece to add to your already classy wardrobe, and for good reason. This favorite fabric of the Duke of Windsor, <span> his grandfather King Edward VII and his father, King George V, will keep you looking like a Gentleman throughout the fall.</span></p>
<p>This classic look pairs with dark jeans, gingham and solid colored shirts, as well as most sweaters. Simply put there isn&#8217;t much you can throw at the tweed blazer that won&#8217;t stick. Initially developed by the Scots, (and I tout most of their developments. See: Golf, Scotch, Flasks, The Breech-Loading Rifle, etc.) this sport coat has a way of making you look both classic and modern. Comfortable in the countryside or in the city. </p>

<p>I recommend, as always, <a title="J.Crew's Charcoal Tweed Blazer" target="_blank" href="http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/sportcoatsandvests/Ludlowsportcoats/PRDOVR~17972/17972.jsp">J.Crew&#8217;s</a> Charcoal Tweed Blazer, or a classic Blazer from Harris Tweed (pictured). And as with any Jacket, know your size and trust your tailor.</p>

        <div class="title">The Gentleman's Bookshelf: This Side of Paradise by F. Scott Fitzgerald</div>
        <div class="body"><p>In 1920, at the age of 24, F. Scott Fitzgerald published this semi-autobiographical novel about Amory Blaine, a young attractive Princeton gentleman growing up in elite  Post World War I America. Broken up into 3 books, the novel is a combination of Fitzgerald&#8217;s first manuscript &#8220;The Romantic Egoist&#8221; along with two other significant periods in his life, &#8220;The Interlude&#8221; and  &#8221;The Education of a Personage.&#8221; The book chronicles Amory&#8217;s schooling at St. Regis Preparatory School, then Princeton, Amory joining the army in World War I, and his love and loss of two débutantes. It concludes with Amory&#8217;s iconic lament, &#8221; I know myself, that is all.&#8221;</p>
<p><img align="middle" src="http://mrmorganperiod1.wikispaces.com/file/view/This_Side_of_Paradise_dust_jacket.gif/103101331/This_Side_of_Paradise_dust_jacket.gif" width="386" height="537"/></p>
<p>Taking its title from a line of the Rupert Brooke poem <em>Tiare Tahiti, This Side of Paradise </em>is an elegant crafting of prose and poetry which illustrates the lavish lifestyle of Upper-class America the early 1900s. </p>
<p>This novel reads like a lesson in high society, as well as serves as a guide book for the young man in America. It should be a staple of every Gentleman&#8217;s book shelf.  Written in a style that combines narrative, verse and letters to and from Amory, the novel is unlike Fitzgerald&#8217;s contemporaries. Heralded by the <em>Chicago Tribune as, &#8220;the only adequate study that we have had of the contemporary American in adolescence and young manhood,&#8221; </em>This Side of Paradise is a study of the American Gentleman for the American Gentleman.</p>

        <div class="title">Sunday Hangover Cure</div>
        <div class="body"><p>It has been another long week, even if it was only a 4 day work week. College football started last week and I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;re all still residually hungover from the first game, thursday&#8217;s game, and of course yesterday&#8217;s full day of games. So what will cure what ails you? </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.bcpowder.com/">BC Powder</a> &amp; a complete multivitamin </p>
<p><img height="225" width="300" src="http://www.gsk-cstore.com/images/en/products/main_bcpowder.jpg" align="middle"/></p>
<p>I discovered this little wonder drug on vacation in North Carolina, and I have countless friends who swear by it. It&#8217;s cheap, quick, effective and will make you feel like you didn&#8217;t stay up until 4am drinking with the pretty girl from across the room (you know, the one who should <a target="_blank" href="http://americangentleman.tumblr.com/post/1049077932/lesson-no-13-the-american-gentleman-is-a-socialite">know your name</a>) </p>
<p><strong>What it is: </strong>essentially a powdered advil with added caffeine (think Excedrin in powder form) .</p>
<p><strong>Directions: </strong>mix one packet with a full glass of water, stir well and chug (it does not taste great) . Take the multi-vitamin immediately after the powder with a little more water to wash the powder taste down.</p>
<p><strong>How It Works: </strong> The powder goes to work on your head/body aches, the caffeine counters your sleep-deprivation and the water replenishes your dehydrated body. The Multi-vitamin will restore the nutrient&#8217;s you drained from countless hours of tailgating. </p>
<p>Feel better, you&#8217;ve got a full day of NFL football on your hands today!</p>

        <div class="title">Basics: A Note on Grooming</div>
        <div class="body"><p><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is the duty of every gentleman to ensure that he is well kept and presents himself appropriately. Although it is sure to be your charm, wit, and pleasant demeanor that wins over that young woman or seals the deal in that business presentation, the way you look can affect the way you feel and ultimately how others feel about you before you even open your mouth. Here are some tips on the fundamentals that will send you well on your way to looking and feeling great – grooming.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span>Fingernails</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Whether you are shaking a client’s hand, holding a door for that lovely gal, or gracefully wielding a cocktail at dinner, one of the most looked upon aspects of your body is your hands. While they may previously have come as an afterthought, the first thing someone notices when you are motioning with your hand or gripping a glass is your fingernails. It is important to keep your nails looking good because it is a perfect indicator to someone of the quality of your hygiene and your attention to detail.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To keep your nails looking prim, it is good practice to trim them about every 5-7 days. You most definitely do not want your nails peeking over the tips or your fingers. However, when you trim them, you also do not want to cut them all the way down to the cuticles because it is unsightly and quite frankly, can be painful. When trimming your nails, you should not just chop them off at the ends. They should be rounded at the corners so as to create a nice ovular shape. A nail file is useful in obtaining good shape to your nails.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The above information can be repeated about one’s toe nails and comes in handy in the warm months when wearing sandals or enjoying a drink poolside.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span>Haircut</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The most alterable aspect of a gentleman’s natural physique, the haircut can take many forms. While it may be tempting to do so, don’t let your haircut define you. Though it is on the top of your head for everyone to see, it should not be the focus. People should be focused on your eyes and your mouth. The former is where you want them to look and the latter is what you want them to listen to and that is what should be of primary concern to you. That being said, it is still important to make sure that your haircut is classy, but conservative.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I am not here to tell you how to style your hair, but there are some basic guidelines that should be followed when addressing your hair. The volume of your hair-do should never be that much greater than the volume of your skull. There should never be a question as to whether a meadowlark is going to fly out of a mop on top of your head. Also, spikes of any kind are expressly prohibited. Your hair is not naturally spiky and there is no reason why you should want to make it that way. Outside of rock bands, hair should never be long enough to hang off of your head. While everyone’s hair grows at different rates, it is usually good practice to get a hair cut every 1-1 ½ months. When your hair starts to naturally lay over your ears, you know you are past due for a cut.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You should trust your hair cut to salon or barbershop where you have a relationship with the professional. Getting a haircut is more than the person just cutting your hair. It is important to build a relationship with him or her. This is important so they know what you want when you come in, how your hair naturally lays, the correct way to texture your hair, and so they can be friendly with you. Every person’s hair is different and it is important that person becomes familiar with it. You should have a good enough relationship with your barber or stylist to invite them to your wedding, or at least a nice dinner.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As far as styling your hair, you can choose to put product in it or just go all natural. Whatever you do, your hair should not be goopy, stiff or shiny. Your hair should not still be perfect after a windy day. Good product to go with is one that will provide a matte finish and still remain pliable throughout the day. A good example of this is American Crew’s Fiber. It can be found at the link below:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span>Body Hair</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Unless your gal expressly tells you that she enjoys a nice mane, it is good practice to keep your body hair to a minimum. Now, different gentlemen can have differing degrees of body hair, so it is up to you to choose your method of trimming (scissors, razor, tweezers, etc). Just know that it should never be so thick to where you can’t see the skin beneath the hair. Also, don’t let it accumulate at the nipples or around the naval.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Every gentleman should have a handheld mirror as well so they can inspect the back of their neck and their back. It is good practice to trim your neck hair every few days so as to keep your hairline neat. A razor is generally a sufficient device for this.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span>Facial Hair</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Much like body hair, unless you have been told by your lady to keep a bear/goatee/mustache, you should not have one. Some women like hair on their men’s faces and that is up to them, but generally, a gentleman is clean cut. However, it is okay to let a couple days of stubble grow as long as you do not have an event and you are not working (read: it&#8217;s the weekend). This is also a very good indicator to someone about how much you care about your appearance, and a gentleman should always be concerned with his appearance.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Those are the basics of what every gentleman should know about grooming. If you continue to brush your teeth, keep those eyebrows, nose hairs, and ear hairs trimmed and follow the simple rules stated above, you will be well on your way to feeling good about yourself and consequently having others feel good about you.<a target="_blank" href="http://royceleathergifts.com/UI/Travel-Grooming-ROYCE-LEATHER-TRAVEL-GROOM-KIT.aspx?ptype=3&amp;mcid=141&amp;pcid=141&amp;ccid=141&amp;pid=173"> A grooming kit like this one</a> should be all you need for proper upkeep.</span></p>

        <div class="title">Arnold Palmer: American Gentleman</div>
        <div class="body"><p><span><span>September 10th was The King&#8217;s birthday (I know we&#8217;re a little late to the party), but my Father shared this story of Arnold Palmer with me that every Gentleman should read.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Greatness Comes in All Forms</strong></p>
<p><span><span>Before the 1993 Senior British Open, which was scheduled to be contested over the links </span><span>of Royal Lytham &amp; St. Annes, Arnold Palmer received a letter from a Mr. Hans Bolton of Lancashire , England . The letter containing, as it did, the language of someone who knew nothing about the game, might have offended a superstar too full of his own importance. In Palmer&#8217;s case, the handwritten letter caught his attention.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><img width="217" height="265" src="https://mail.google.com/mail/?ui=2&amp;ik=5b276005b1&amp;view=att&amp;th=12b1fb48492c6811&amp;attid=0.1&amp;disp=emb&amp;zw"/></span><br/>The letter, which came into the possession of a friend several years later, contains this remark in the opening paragraph, “I must admit I am not a golf fan. I realize that you must be extremely busy, being one of the “big names” in the golfing fraternity.” Bolton then talks about the importance of the upcoming Senior Open but adds, “An even more important event is taking place (at least to me anyway). You see, I am getting married to my fiancée Sally Anne Murphy, a truly gorgeous and wonderful girl.” The problem, as Bolton unfolds, is simple, neither of the honeymoon suites at the Clifton Arms Hotel is available because, as it was explained to him, “Mr. Arnold Palmer is staying in one and Mr. Gary Player is staying in the other, and they have been booked for ages!”</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br/>The letter then proceeded to paint an emotional portrait. “My fiancée was, of course, distraught at this news, convinced that our big day is doomed to failure. Something I suppose, like a triple bogey on the 1st hole.” Then Bolton makes a daring suggestion. “I was just wondering if perhaps, there would be any chance at all of you swapping rooms with us, just for one night. This is a shot in the dark, I really don&#8217;t expect that you will, but one can only try. You see I work for the Sunblest Bread Company and Sally works as a children&#8217;s nanny so this is probably the only chance we will ever have of staying anywhere as grand as the Clifton Arms.”<br/>He signed the letter “Yours hopefully,” and then added two postscripts. P.S. You are more than welcome to join us for a drink at the reception. P.P.S. I didn&#8217;t write to Gary Player because we were told you were a much nicer chap!<br/>Palmer, of course, not only surrendered the suite but took them up on the offer of the beer where he drank a toast to the happy couple and even posed for a photograph. </span></span></p>
<p><span>No matter who you are, remember,  the smallest acts of civility and kindness can go the longest way in making someone&#8217;s day. Be a true American Gentleman.</span></p>

        <div class="title">The Ryder Cup: A Return to Gentlemanliness </div>
        <div class="body"><p>The Ryder Cup Team just recently announced that the U.S. Men will be wearing classic uniforms for the tournament and for practice that hearken back to a time when golf was played by gentlemen only. Aiming for an upper-class preppy look the team&#8217;s uniforms were made by Peter Millar, a golf apparel firm. The designs include horizontal striped shirt and sweaters with windowpane or argyle designs. They all feature wool trousers in olive, British Khaki and a traditional khaki. The team&#8217;s competition uniforms are reminiscent of 1930&#8217;s golf style and all feature cardigans with an embroidered red crest on the chest.</p>

<p>Team USA will be shooting for high class for the matches in Celtic Manor, Wales. These uniforms are a return the the gentlemanliness of the game of golf, both in the fashion and the statement they make. The US Ryder Cup team will feature America&#8217;s star golfers in an homage to golf&#8217;s proud and elegant history. </p>

        <div class="title">Gentleman's Essentials: The Navy Blazer</div>
        <div class="body"><p><span> </span>Okay, I&#8217;ll admit it. I&#8217;ve gotten a little blazer happy. But it&#8217;s fall and I&#8217;m tired of seeing so many Affliction Hoodies, that something had to be done. A Gentleman should never commit that faux pas. Despite this &#8220;trend&#8221;, there is no denying that the blue (read navy) blazer is a cornerstone of a Gentleman&#8217;s wardrobe. The Preppy Handbook goes so far as to note that &#8220;every single one of us owns a Blue Blazer&#8221; and you should be no exception. A classic two button blue blazer, complete with gold buttons will make any Gentleman feel like he can take on the world (or at least conquer happy hour).</p>
<p><img height="400" width="314" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_DvyYQdnG-5E/SqTgw5CquhI/AAAAAAAAArw/_Jr5mHW553U/s400/JPress+Navy+Blazer.jpg" align="middle"/></p>
<p><strong>Why You Should Own One:</strong></p>
<p><span> </span>The blue blazer is classic American style. Your Grandfather wore one, your Father wore one, now it&#8217;s high time that you carried on the Gentlemanly tradition. It pairs with jeans or khakis, can be worn in any social situation that requires only a jacket. It never seems to look too dressed up, giving you a casual feel with a little sharper look. The blazer gives you the option of dressing up your every day look while also allowing you the luxury of <a target="_blank" href="http://americangentleman.tumblr.com/post/1121365298/lesson-no-24-if-she-is-cold-give-her-your-jacket">giving her your jacket when she&#8217;s cold. </a></p>
<p><strong>Where You Can Get It:</strong></p>
<p>This staple is not hard to come by, and depending on the quality of the blazer they can range from a few dollars to a month&#8217;s rent. Brooks Brother&#8217;s offers <a target="_blank" href="http://www.brooksbrothers.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Merchant_Id=1&amp;Section_Id=679&amp;Product_Id=831515&amp;Parent_Id=217&amp;sort_by=&amp;sectioncolor=&amp;sectionsize=">The Classic 2-Button Blazer </a> for $528 dollars. While this is the quintessential jacket, it&#8217;s a little too rich for my blood (no pun intended). If you&#8217;re not willing to spend the big bucks, it&#8217;s time to hunt one of these blazer&#8217;s down.</p>
<ul><li>First start with your father or grandfather. There is a high likelihood they have an extra jacket that you could borrow (read keep). Make sure to have it tailored to fit.</li>
<li>Never underestimate the power of the internet. Scour ebay, Gilt.com, even j.crew and Ralph Lauren sales will sometimes have a treasure trove of jackets</li>
<li>Be sure to check your local vintage store. If you hunt long enough you&#8217;re bound to find something you like. Make sure to bring it to your tailor.</li>
</ul><p>These jackets were so common that it&#8217;s not difficult to find one at a steal, if you&#8217;re willing to hunt long and hard enough (I found my Brooks Brothers blazer for $6 at a vintage store). </p>
<p><strong>How You Should Wear It:</strong></p>
<p>Dress up the blazer with a nice tie and a button down shirt or ditch the tie for a more casual look (just be sure to <a target="_blank" href="http://americangentleman.tumblr.com/post/1042991831/lesson-no-10-the-buttons-on-a-button-down-collar-are">remember Lesson No. 10</a>). Also never pair the navy blazer with black trousers and a black belt, you might as well be wearing a graphic jacket with the words &#8220;Ed Hardy&#8221; embroidered on it at that point. The most important thing to remember is to wear the jacket however you&#8217;re comfortable, and always with a classy elegance Don&#8217;t forget to get it tailored!</p>

        <div class="title">Fall Essentials: The Southern Tide Pullover</div>
        <div class="body"><p>Fall weather is finally here. It&#8217;s sweater and oxford season (let&#8217;s be honest, it&#8217;s always Oxford season.) Few pieces of a Gentleman&#8217;s wardrobe look better in 50 degree weather than a quarter-zip pullover layered over the Oxford you&#8217;ve got tucked in to those slacks (most of the pieces that do look better are suits).</p>
<p>Our friends over at <a title="Southern Tide" target="_blank" href="http://southerntide.com">Southern Tide </a>have my favorite pullover of the year. It&#8217;s relatively inexpensive, high quality and as sharp as it gets. Not to mention the fit is perfect. This is something every Gentleman should have in his closet. It&#8217;s versatility alone makes the pullover a sweater you can wear through the winter and far into the spring. It&#8217;s lighter weight and soft enough that she&#8217;ll be begging for you to<a target="_blank" href="http://americangentleman.tumblr.com/post/1038648419/lesson-no-9-dont-hold-her-hand-give-her-your-arm"> give her your arm</a>.</p>

<p>The great part about this casual sweater is that it is sharp enough to wear on a date with her and casual enough to wear on the boat. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to make a statement while <a target="_blank" href="http://americangentleman.tumblr.com/post/1093390559/lesson-no-20-always-maintain-a-casual-elegance">maintaining a casual elegance</a>. It looks best unzipped and unrolled, just make sure your oxford is tucked in and your sleeves are buttoned to show off a little cuff. </p>

        <div class="title">The Last Khaki Pants You'll Ever Need</div>
        <div class="body"><p>I recently received a pair of <a target="_blank" href="http://store.southerntide.com/product/skipjack-khakis-1009.cfm">Southern Tide &#8220;Channel Markers&#8221; Khakis </a>as a gift. From the moment I put these pants on I knew that I was sold. They are lightweight and remarkably soft, yet are durable and warm enough for the 35 degree morning I had to endure last week.  Most importantly they are a classic style that is timeless. They look crisp and professional while at the same time conjuring up images of being barefoot at the beach or on the boat.</p>
<p>The pants are also remarkably affordable. They&#8217;ll run you about $98.00 (before shipping), which is more pricey than a pair of Dockers, but less than a pair from Ralph Lauren. I can assure you these pants surpass both of those brands in every imaginable category. </p>
<p><img height="400" width="300" src="http://www.esquire.com/cm/esquire/images/kentucky-derby-southern-tide-pants-042910-lg-54020087.jpg" align="middle"/></p>
<p>The details set them apart as well, featuring rear buttons with navigational colored button thread. The right button is stitched with red thread and the left with a green thread. The pockets are roomy enough to hold everything you need (money clip, cell phone, car keys are all you need), without being bulky. Made of 98% cotton and 2% lycra with a durable stitching, these pants just beg to be worn in the salty ocean air. </p>
<p>To top off the comfort, classic style and general wear-ability of the pants, the tag gave me further proof that these pants were designed by and for Gentlemen. The pants were designed by Allen Stephenson in honor of a legendary man of the waterway Hugh &#8220;Bo&#8221; Faulkner III. The tag reads:</p>
<p><span> </span>&#8220;<em>You might find Bo in Washington having cocktails with politicians, or you <span> </span>may see him out late at night with famous musicians. You may catch him <span> </span>on a midnight flight to Buenos Aries or navigating the Intracoastal Water <span> </span>Way. No matter where you find Bo, you can be sure he is living his life to the <span> </span>fullest and helping others to do the same.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I have khaki pants from other clothiers, in fact there&#8217;s a whole section of my closet that&#8217;s khaki (I recommend you do the same, if only because you can wear them in any situation). None of these pants share the Gentlemanly sentiment conveyed above. Moreover, none of my other pants come close to this level of comfort, fit this well and look this sharp. Pick up a pair online or at your local haberdasher. </p>

        <div class="title">Happy Thanksgiving - here's a tip</div>
        <div class="body"><p>The American Gentleman plays an active role in all aspects of Thanksgiving Dinner.  Even if you aren&#8217;t the iron chef, there are plenty of ways to help on Thanksgiving day. Want to impress your family (or her family) learn how to set the table properly. </p>
<p>Here’s how to set the table.</p>
<ol><li><em>How many people will be in attendance? </em> If there are children coming, consider a separate children’s table.</li>
<li><em>Where do you want everyone to sit? </em> Consider a few matters of convenience such as the cook sitting near the kitchen door, parents sitting next to children, or which people would interact best with others.  There are also matters of tradition to consider, such as a male guest traditionally being seated on the hostess’s Left, and a female guest traditionally being seated at the host’s right.  Often times people alternate between men and women, but this is no longer necessary.</li>
<li><em>Do I use a tablecloth?</em>  It’s entirely up to the host, and depends what type of food you are serving and mood you hope to create.  If you choose to use a table cloth, remember to have the middle crease run straight down the center of the table and it should hang about 18 inches off the table.  If it’s a buffet dinner, it should hang to the floor.</li>
<li><em>Where do I position the plates, glasses and utensils</em>?  Use the picture below to guide you:</li>
</ol><p><img class="img" src="http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/hs151.ash2/40878_449306366177_89114011177_5171955_3178137_n.jpg" onload="var img = this; onloadRegister(function() { adjustImage(img); });"/></p>
<p>A few things to remember:</p>
<ul><li>Fold the napkins and place them in either the center of each diner’s place, under the forks on the left, in an empty water glass.</li>
<li>Place the large dinner fork to the left and the smaller salad for to the left of the dinner fork.</li>
<li>Place a knife to the right of the napkin, with the cutting edge toward the plate.  This is an old custom to prevent aggressive behavior at the dinner table.    </li>
</ul><p><em>When do I begin clearing the table?</em>  When the last person if finished eating, you may begin to clear the plates.  When the diner has finished, he/she signals this by setting the fork and knife parallel to each other, so they lie either horizontally across the plate or on the diagnal at approximately 4&#160;o&#8217;clock.</p>
<p>Setting the table seems like a small gesture, but if done well can be very impressive. Clearing the table is also a great way to show that you&#8217;re thoughtful and considerate without having to do a whole lot of actual work.  Now that you&#8217;ve done your part, grab a seat on the couch and enjoy some football and a nap!</p>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving from the American Gentleman!</p></div>

        <div class="title">I&#039;m curious as to what an American Gentleman believes about shaving. Should it be done with a straight razor? Owning two straight razors, I believe the shave is superior, and is cheaper in the longrun for the Gentleman than disposables. And it helps the environment because disposables are not being thrown away.</div>
        <div class="body"><p>Right now I have a beard, so I&#8217;m boycotting shaving. As far as straight razors vs disposables go there is a mixed bag of pros and cons for both. I prefer a straight razor in the hands of my barber than myself at 6am before work. Disposables are just more convenient for the busy lifestyle of a Gentleman, however never underestimate a straight razor in the hands of your barber, it&#8217;s an unmatched feeling.  </p></div>

        <div class="title">For the last year or so, I have been a houseguest in the home of my girlfriend&#039;s gracious sister &amp; husband, while I complete Graduate School.  I graduate on Friday, and my parents and I would like to give them a gift as a token of our immense appreciation.  However, we have had a difficult time thinking of an ideal gift.  Any suggestions?</div>
        <div class="body"><p>Send them out to a nice dinner date on you. It&#8217;ll give them a night out of the house, together, free from distractions. Pay for the night out for them, pick a nice place for dinner and maybe an event afterward (a movie, a show, etc.). Also, get them a card or write them a letter expressing your true gratitude for their gift to you. </p></div>

        <div class="body"><p>I always go for vintage jewelry. It&#8217;s less expensive, the pieces are rare if not one of a kind, and they are of the same quality (usually, examine them carefully) that you would find at full price. Most jewelers have vintage pieces if you ask specifically for them. </p>
<p>Seeing as you just got her a rock for that ring finger however, It might be a good idea to actually make her gift. A collage of old photos that you could frame will always make her melt. </p></div>

<p>Cars: I&#8217;ll never judge a person by the car they drive, my preference is for luxury vehicles (though I don&#8217;t drive one), and my opinion about pick-up trucks is that they are for work first. I don&#8217;t care for them for many reasons, which I won&#8217;t mention. </p></div>

        <div class="body"><p>I&#8217;d say whenever there&#8217;s snow on the ground or rain. They&#8217;re pretty standard in the winter anyway though so wear without hesitation. Some great RedWings (they make an awesome chukka boot too) will also pair with most anything casual for the winter. As for work, skip the duck boots. </p></div>

        <div class="title">What&#039;s a classy, yet manly, messenger bag for a Colleged-aged gentleman about to finish up his undergrad and go on to law school? I think it&#039;s about that time to step up from the Jansport to something a little more mature.</div>
        <div class="body"><p>You know, I&#8217;ve never really been sold on the idea that a messenger bag doesn&#8217;t look like a purse. But I&#8217;m a little old fashioned. I carried the same backpack from high school all the way through law school, though it would probably look strange with a suit now. </p>
<p>I&#8217;d say for law school, keep the backpack. The casebooks are heavy, awful books, that won&#8217;t fit in most messenger bags or laptop bags. Wait until you graduate law school. The most common gift people get graduating law students are brief cases. Trust me. </p>
<p>If you absolutely must have a messenger bag, and you&#8217;re convinced it looks manly, I do happen to like this <a target="_blank" href="http://www.csnstores.com/asp/superbrowse.asp?clid=710&amp;caid=&amp;sku=XB1787&amp;refid=FR49-XB1787">David King North South Messenger Bag</a> (it&#8217;s also on sale and has free shipping/no tax).</p></div>

What brand of scotch do you prefer?  What is the ideal brand to drink while not coming off as too mainstream (think johnny walker) or too snobbish (think bring my own single malt early 1900&#039;s bottle to bar) <br />
<br />
Thx,<br />
<br />
Brian</div>
        <div class="body"><p>I really like Oban, a nice island single malt with a smokey and peaty flavor. It&#8217;s really about sampling different types and flavors until you find one that works for you. There are so many regions of Scotland that produce such varrient scotch flavors you have lots of room to explore.</p>
<p>Nothing wrong with JW Black or Blue (or even Red if you&#8217;re working on the cheap). Nothing wrong with the more well known Glenfiddich and Glenlivet. </p>
<p>I prefer older vintages. The joke amongst my fellow Gentlemen is we like our women like our scotch, at least 18 years old, preferably 21. </p></div>

        <div class="title">You seem to know a lot about life and love.... Where do you get all of these gentlemanly ideas and tips? Do you use them on the girl who has your heart? Or is she the one that taught you so well?</div>
        <div class="body"><p>Mark Twain said write about what you know. My Grandparents and parents taught me well, I suppose. I also read, a lot. Experience has taught me many of these things. Others are general observations on how people act (or don&#8217;t know how to act in civil society). </p>
<p>As far as using them on a girl who has my heart, that&#8217;s a whole different story. I haven&#8217;t met that girl yet (or maybe I have and don&#8217;t know it). </p></div>

        <div class="title">Can we turn the situation around? How should a classy lady go about getting the attention of the gentleman whom she favours without seeming too forward or too uninterested? What would make a good impression on a gentleman?</div>
        <div class="body"><p>Intelligence and wit. Anyone can dress-up, put on pearls and look nice (and trust me we love that). Few ladies can keep up with sarcasm, dish it out as well as take it. Wit is very attractive. Intelligence is also key. Nobody wants to talk to a boring lady or one who seems clueless. </p>
<p>Making a good first impression is also about leaving us wanting a little more. The chase can be fun. </p></div>

        <div class="title">What do you like about J. Crew? Because I agree with the person on your fanpage that J.Crew isn&#039;t a very good brand.</div>
        <div class="body"><p>If you&#8217;ve been inside their Men&#8217;s Shop on Madison Ave. you would understand. There&#8217;s not much to dislike about a classically American brand. I like it for the same reasons I like Brooks Brothers and Ralph Lauren. It&#8217;s a brand endorsed by Presidents and worn by the Prep Schoolers. If it&#8217;s good enough for JFK, it&#8217;s good enough for me. </p>
<p>As I mentioned when I first started writing this, however, the brand is less important than how you wear it (with obvious exceptions, see Suits). But to say that J.Crew is a poor brand is the same as saying &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand clothing, my parents still shop for me and my girlfriend dresses me.&#8221; </p></div>

        <div class="title">How does a Gentleman meet his girlfriends family (siblings, parents, and extended family) and leave a great first impression without seeming cocky or as a threat to her (your girlfriend) wellbeing.  In other words, how can I show her family that I am a great guy and that she is lucky to be with someone like me without seeming too good to be true?</div>
        <div class="body"><p>Well there are a few things here. First, don&#8217;t assume she is lucky to be with someone like you, her family won&#8217;t (frankly, you&#8217;re probably lucky to be with her). Second, a first impression is made within 8 seconds of meeting you. That means in 8 seconds they already know how they feel about you and that feeling is unlikely to change. Eye contact, confidence, smile, stand up straight and be well dressed.  Third, her father will always view you as a threat, so win over her mother and siblings. The father will come around eventually (you&#8217;ll bond over baseball or business or something similar). </p>
<p>The best way to make an impression, I&#8217;ve found, is confidence and remembering everyone&#8217;s names. If you think you&#8217;re going to seem cocky, they&#8217;ll think you&#8217;re an arrogant child. Treat her family like you would treat your own, with respect and kindness. </p></div>

        <div class="title">Is it still acceptable to order for your classy lady during a dinner date?</div>
        <div class="body"><p>Acceptable, sure. Does it make you look bad? Probably. Will she be thrilled with it? Doubtful.</p>
<p>Let her order first. You just worry about the check. </p></div>

        <div class="title">What&#039;s the etiquette when taking my new &quot;significant other&quot; out to dinner for his birthday? I&#039;ve gotten him a gift, and I know he&#039;ll decline the offer, but do I even offer to pay for the dinner? I know traditionally the gentlemen pays - always (and he does) - but is this the rare execption?</div>
        <div class="body"><p>Sounds like a good plan. Before the check comes, just get up to go to the restroom and slip your credit card to the waiter. It&#8217;s a surefire move that never fails. This also works in large groups too. </p></div>

        <div class="title">Were you in a fraternity? If so, did that have any influence on your thoughts about &quot;The American Gentleman&quot;?</div>
        <div class="body"><p>Yes I was in a fraternity. I felt that the fraternity helped shape my character and instilled values that I have carried with me to this day. The fraternity was an invaluable resource in my life as it gave me direction in college, focused my talents towards a common goal and gave me life-long brothers with whom I have a shared bond. Without the fraternity, I would not be the man I am today. </p></div>

        <div class="title">What are some good everyday watches for an American Gentleman to wear?</div>
        <div class="body"><p>Lot&#8217;s of watch questions these days. If I wear a watch it&#8217;s typically my grandfather&#8217;s watch, which was given to me years ago. My suggestions for watches are this. Find something that looks classic and timeless (no pun). Find a watch that will stand the test of time (again no pun, you want to be able to pass it down to your posterity) and find a watch that goes with your wardrobe and is comfortable.</p>
<p>The rest is a matter of personal style and choice. I have leather band watches (Timex has some great ones like the 1600 which was a JFK favorite) but I also have metal bands. It&#8217;s all a matter of personal preference. It has to be comfortable as well as stylish and classic. </p>
<p>And just because I think they&#8217;re great, when you hit it big, go for the Rolex. Just for kicks. </p></div>

        <div class="body"><p>Petty Coats (or Pea Coats) are always acceptable. They&#8217;re stately, professional and durable. They also don&#8217;t make you look bulky. I wear a pea coat on a daily basis when the weather turns cold enough and have gotten nothing but compliments. Yes they are quite acceptable, that&#8217;s why you see president&#8217;s giving their inaugural addresses in them. </p></div>

        <div class="title">AG, for a college-aged gentleman preparing for coming internship interviews and entering the work-force in a year, what are some affordable, yet classy, brands of suiting that will make me look great when I walk into a prospective employers office? Also, if you could only have one suit option, what color/pattern/style would you choose? -Drew</div>
        <div class="body"><p>Being a college student, interviewers don&#8217;t expect you to walk into the room in a $5,000 suit. If you need a suit, on the cheap, I suggest Joseph A. Bank. As cheesy as it sounds, you can get a suit for a couple hundred bucks, they&#8217;ll tailor it for you, and it&#8217;ll survive a couple interviews. </p>
<p>As far as my suit options, I have many, but my go-to suit option is navy, flat front, with a white pocket square to set it off. A light gray in the spring is always a good one too. </p></div>

We don&#8217;t wear S,M,L any more (except the occasional tee-shirt). Learn your measurements, your shirt size in collar and sleeve, your suit jacket size, your waist and inseam. Shoes come in width as well as length. A Gentleman is as familiar with his measurements as his tailor. </p></div>

        <div class="body"><p>You weren&#8217;t being careless. We can&#8217;t control the gifts others give us. The best way to show her that her gift meant a lot to her is two fold. First, hang the framed photo somewhere prominent. You want everyone to see it, comment on it, notice it. Second, write her a handwritten thank you letter, and tell her how much it meant to you. </p></div>

        <div class="title">As a gentleman in college, I typically dress as more of a &quot;young professional&quot; and I am very diligent in my studies so I can attend a prestigious law school. While many girls find these qualities attractive, I find that many of them have less than a pure affection for me. How might a college-aged gentleman be able to tell the difference between a true &quot;lady&quot; and a girl who&#039;s simply attracted to his lifestyle?</div>
        <div class="body"><p>There will always be girls who love the law school bit. Trust me I know from experience (Going to law school attracted the wrong type for me, many times over). The difference between a &#8220;lady&#8221; and a &#8220;girl&#8221; is simply that. One is a girl, attracted to your lifestyle and the other is a lady, attracted to you. The only way to know for sure is to just dive in and find out for yourself. People tend to reveal their true colors eventually.  Patience.</p></div>

I&#039;m in college and there is a girl in one of my classes that I&#039;m trying to catch but she has a boyfriend who is completely different from myself(I&#039;m a prep and he&#039;s far from it) and this girl and i talk everyday and lightly flirt so how should i go about trying to win her over from her boyfriend of over a year?</div>
        <div class="body"><p>First, no Gentleman steals a girl from another man. There&#8217;s plenty of fish in the sea, as the old adage goes. Second, if you do try to &#8220;win her over&#8221; so to speak, just make sure you know how to throw a punch, cause there&#8217;s a likelihood her old boyfriend knows how to throw a punch, and will. </p></div>

        <div class="title">Why does a gentleman need to learn how to fight? Shouldn&#039;t the gentleman be above such neanderthal means of dealing with their problems.  So many of your lessons are on rhetoric so why not use the gentleman&#039;s ability to communicate effectively to solve any problem instead of lowering our class and fighting.</div>
        <div class="body"><p>Fighting does not necessarily imply physical violence. A Gentleman knows how to fight, how to put everything on the line for something he desires. He also knows how to defend himself when the other guy takes a swing (and the other guy will take a swing, sooner or later). </p></div>

Just to be able to dance well with my sweetheart at a wedding, gala or other event.</div>

As Thoreau said, &#8220;I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck all the marrow of life.&#8221;</p></div>

        <div class="body"><p>A driving cap, much like a fedora, has a cool, classic look to it. The problem is not many people can pull them off. If you don&#8217;t mind the extra attention (and you will get a lot of attention being the only one wearing a hat that isn&#8217;t a ball cap) and you can actually pull it off, I say go for it. Style is as much about looking crisp and clean as it is about taking risks.</p></div>

I&#039;m a college-aged fraternity man with a very classic style of dress (aka I dress like my father and grandfather).  For birthdays and holidays, I&#039;ve received a few nice cashmere scarves which I think are great, but I am hesitant to wear them.  In a few years, I will undoubtedly wear one over a fine suit with an overcoat, but what is your take on them in the college years?</div>
        <div class="body"><p>I wear a scarf with my overcoat almost every day in the winter. In college I didn&#8217;t wear scarves as often, if at all. Mostly, I didn&#8217;t wear them for fear of losing them or spilling a beer on them. For now, I&#8217;d save them for more formal occasions or dates. Or save them for the nights you know you&#8217;re not going to need to call pledges to pick you up. </p></div>

        <div class="title">I would first like to say how greatly I appreciate your work with this blog and every man, young or old, should be aware of the lessons you teach on here. We even use your blog to point new fraternity members down the right path to &quot;manhood&quot;. I was curious on your etiquette when rolling up the sleeves on a button down. I find myself instantly rolling my sleeves up when I get to class and begin taking notes because it&#039;s almost like a subconscious way to put myself in work mode, but I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s an old fashioned tradition for gentlemen to not show skin above their wrists and below the neck. Your thoughts?</div>
        <div class="body"><p>I get to the office, I pour a cup of coffee and I roll my sleeves. It&#8217;s time to work and my sleeves are up. If I have a meeting, need to go to court or do something else that is more formal my sleeves are down, buttoned and I have a blazer or jacket on. Tie tied tight, top button buttoned until the first drink is finished. </p></div>

        <div class="title">As a matter of personal preference, I prefer a bow tie over the necktie. During my undergraduate years, I frequently wore bow ties to fraternity and sorority formals, and to college functions. Consequently, I have found myself thinking of bow ties in the light of a &quot;fun&quot; accessory, and thus have dismissed them as appropriate for certain occasions. Could you please discern when it is, and when it is not appropriate to wear a bow tie, and perhaps when it would be more appropriate to wear a necktie in the &quot;real world?&quot; (Examples perhaps being business, interviews, a date, meeting a lady&#039;s parents for dinner, etc.)</div>
        <div class="body"><p>Business or interviews wear a neck tie. Less formal social gatherings wear the bow-tie. I was taught that they were the &#8220;fun&#8221; accessory, but they are distracting in business and especially in interviews. Save them for rare occasions, like black tie affairs. </p></div>

        <div class="title">I am a student in Kentucky, with an Interview in Dallas in a few weeks.   I will be flying there for the interview, and then flying back on the next day.  The interview will happen on the day I return.  They told me the dress code is Business Casual, as there will be a tour of a manufacturing site.  Would the American Gentleman wear a full suit on the day of the interview?  And if he would, how would you suggest packing?  If no suit is needed, what is the American Gentleman&#039;s suggestion for attire?</div>
        <div class="body"><p>First, you don&#8217;t need a suit, but bring a sport coat for the flight. I&#8217;ve found that if you fly with a sport coat on you get treated much better (last time I flew, it resulted in a few free cocktails). Second, the attire is business casual so dress business casual. Dress shoes, matching belt, slacks (something gray or olive) and a button down oxford. That should work fine. Pack a tie just in case you feel it absolutely necessary. The most important part of the interview is to feel comfortable and confident. They&#8217;ll care less about your tie (or lack there of) if they feel that you are someone they can actually see themselves working with. </p></div>

        <div class="body"><p>Depending on where you are lunching, I say wear a suit. If you&#8217;re overdressed you can take off your jacket and roll up your sleeves, loosen your tie, etc. Remember it&#8217;s always better to be overdressed than under dressed. </p></div>

Most high school and college age men don&#8217;t have the confidence to pull off a cardigan and you&#8217;ll likely catch some hell for it. I still do sometimes.

If you&#8217;re in dress shoes, wear dress socks. If you&#8217;re working out, wear socks. Otherwise you don&#8217;t necessarily need them. I don&#8217;t wear them with loafers or espadrilles.

        <div class="body"><p>I drink gin and whiskey. My scotch is neat, bourbon on the rocks and gin mixed with tonic. I also enjoy whiskey/scotch and water or soda. If I&#8217;m drinking anything fancy it&#8217;s either a Gibson or an Old Fashioned. The brands vary (depending on my mood or even the economy). When it comes to cocktails,  just keep it simple. </p></div>

        <div class="title">Gentleman's Essentials: The Bow Tie</div>
        <div class="body"><p>We all have occasion to wear a bow tie. They&#8217;re a classic look that can be used to show a Gentleman&#8217;s fun side while in formal dress. All month we&#8217;ve been talking about our friends at Buffalo and Company, and their bow tie has surpassed our expectations. </p>
<p>A rugged and durable (read: will last forever), yet elegant and classy bow tie, Buffalo and Company offers their both a Signature Series and a Wildlife Series. From signatures of Teddy Roosevelt to Thomas Jefferson, and wildlife you wouldn&#8217;t hesitate to hunt, these bow ties are a slightly western take on the traditional look.</p>

        <div class="title">American Gentleman- I am looking to buy my first bow tie (from Buffalo &amp; Company), and I am not sure what color or series pattern to get. As someone who has never worn this kind of bow tie before, could you share any recommendation you may have as to what color would be a good choice for the first-time bow tie owner looking for versatility (i.e. being able to wear it with differently colored outfits/shirts)? Also, do you feel that one of Buffalo &amp; Company&#039;s tie series (Wildlife &amp; Signature) would be a better choice for someone&#039;s first bow tie than the other; and if so, which one? Your advice is greatly appreciated.</div>
        <div class="body"><p>I believe that blue goes with most anything. I think the signature series is a little more professional while the wildlife series is more fun-loving. Enjoy!</p></div>

        <div class="body"><p>I feel like I get this a lot. Being a Gentleman is not about the brands you wear. It&#8217;s about civility and class with charm. Be charming, be confident. Be well put together. A confident Gentleman in a $15 dollar oxford will outshine someone in Brooks Brothers who lacks confidence. Trust me. </p></div>

<p>As for jeans, stick with a solid color tee, a casual sport shirt or polos. Check out Southern Tide for some great casual wear. Shoes, stick with boat shoes or loafers. A nice driving shoe works well too. </p></div>

        <div class="title">AG - how do you suggest a gentleman handles a situation where a girl he especially likes and has become close with but has a &quot;boyfriend&quot;? The boyfriend is clearly not good enough for her and their relationship isn&#039;t serious. Should he follow the saying &quot;if you want something, go out and get it&quot; or wait?</div>
        <div class="body"><p>It&#8217;s not for you to decide who is good enough for her, that&#8217;s up to her. Also it&#8217;s presumptuous to assume that you are good enough for her, if you&#8217;re trying to steal her from her current boyfriend I&#8217;d say you&#8217;re likely not.</p>
<p>If you want something go get it is a good mantra until you get hit in the mouth by her current boyfriend. There are plenty of fish, as the saying goes. </p></div>

        <div class="title">I will be working as an intern for a senator this coming june or july, I imagine the dress code will be business, i.e. suit and tie, how does the American Gentleman feel about a blue/white seersucker suit to wear on Seersucker thursdays? Would this be too flashy/inappropiate for a position as low on the totem pole as intern? Thanks for any advice.</div>
        <div class="body"><p>This would be something I would wait and see on. Give it a few weeks to get accustomed to The Hill and work. See what the other people in your office are doing before you jump right in. Usually I would say you&#8217;re fine, but being an intern is a precarious position, especially if you hope to work for the Senator in the future.

        <div class="title">A co worker of mine, whom I previously saw as a friend has begun taking my (recently) ex-girlfriend out. I&#039;m torn between acting unshaken and letting my indifference speak for me, and punching this jerk directly in the mouth. He still acts as if there&#039;s nothing wrong with the whole situation. I&#039;m not mad at her for seeing other people, we have seperated, but I find it very slimy to date a friends ex. What is the gentlemsn&#039;s route?</div>
        <div class="body"><p>A gentleman never dates his friends exes. If someone decides to date yours just remember, she&#8217;s an ex for a reason. Let him deal with her, there&#8217;s plenty of other women out there. </p></div>

Can a gentleman have long hair? I have large and distinctive facial features that I feel short hair shows off to much. My hair is medium length at the present but I am considering letting it grow out. It was longer at one point and the girls, at least, seemed to really like it. What&#039;re your thoughts? Also, can a gentleman have a pony tail?</div>
        <div class="body"><p>A few guys can pull off the longer &#8220;shaggy&#8221; look, but long hair on men is not acceptable. Especially if it&#8217;s pony tail length. If you have a pony tail, I will be buying you a pink bow to wear in it. </p></div>

2. Any advice for how to pick and get into a good law school?<br />
3. Any advice for how to not only succeed but excell in law school?<br />

        <div class="title">Dear AG,<br />
I consider myself a budding American gentleman at heart and in practice, but for the life of me I have trouble making good first impressions with confidence and grace. It is only once I get to know someone when I feel comfortable being my normal (I like to think charming) self. Do you have any advice, short of sheer practice and experience, that will help me overcome this problem of confidence in making first impressions?</div>
        <div class="body"><p>If you consider yourself charming, yet you make poor first impressions then there is work to be done. The easiest way to make a good first impression is with eye contact and listening. You don&#8217;t need to prove anything to anyone. Just relax, make eye contact, listen when they speak and respond appropriately. Don&#8217;t try to be charming, if you have to try then it&#8217;s not coming off right. Being charming is something that is effortless (and often times something that you&#8217;re either born with or not). In this case it sounds like you&#8217;re talking too much, showing off and bragging a bit to compensate for your not feeling comfortable. </p></div>

        <div class="body"><p>Chin up, try to learn something and then it&#8217;s on to what&#8217;s next. Don&#8217;t dwell on the things you cannot change. Like Thomas Edison said, <span style="line-height: 13px;">&#8220;I didn&#8217;t fail, I just found 10,000 ways that didn&#8217;t work.&#8221;</span></p></div>

        <div class="title">Lesson No. 116: Give Her Your Coat.</div>
        <div class="body"><p>If it&#8217;s chilly, give her your suit coat or your over coat. If it&#8217;s rainy give her your umbrella. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re cold, it doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re wet. It matters if she is though.  Simple gentlemanly hospitality goes a long way. </p></div>

Its outside at a garden near the beach in NC. What suggestions would you have for a suit? I own suits in grey, black, navy, and blue seersucker. Thank you for your advice.</div>
        <div class="body"><p>Spring wedding means it&#8217;s time for khaki linen. If that&#8217;s not an option the gray is probably best. Go with conservative colors so as not to draw attention away from the bride. There&#8217;s plenty of time to divert attention away from her at the reception. </p>
<p>On that note: Learn to dance.</p></div>

I personally like them and don&#039;t really care what my brothers say, especially given the compliments I have received for them, but I was hoping to get an &quot;experts&quot; opinion on them, are they shoes of a gentlemen or should they be thrown out of my closet?</div>

        <div class="title">what is the best way to follow up on a job interview?</div>
        <div class="body"><p>First, write a thank you note. Handwritten. Thanking them for the opportunity to interview. </p>
<p>Second, follow up with a phone call a week or so later to check on the hiring process. </p>
<p>Those two steps have worked well for me in the past. Remember, even if you don&#8217;t get the job, you are expanding the radius of your network. Everyone always remembers the guy who hand wrote the thank you letter. </p></div>

        <div class="title">I am spending the summer as an intern for a US Congressman in his home state office. The dress code is slightly different because I am not working on the hill, therefore I need some advice. The attire is Business Casual when the Congressman isn&#039;t in the office and Business Professional on days he is present. What would you suggest wearing for those occasions? Is it alright to wear boat shoes or needlepoint belts for business casual? Also, for business professional should I stick to traditional suits or do you think it is acceptable to wear a tie and blazer? Thanks!</div>
        <div class="body"><p>Business professional means a suit. Not a blazer and a tie. A suit. For business casual, I&#8217;d hesitate to wear boat shoes and needlepoint belts from the get-go. It&#8217;s not the fraternity house, it&#8217;s a Congressional office. Save those for casual times, not business casual times. </p></div>

Confidence is genuine belief in one&#8217;s self worth, being cocky is all about hubris. Cocky is an act. Confidence is genuine. </p></div>

I&#039;ll soon be beginning an internship that calls for a business casual dress. I know the basics of such a style -- long sleeve button down or polo shirt with neat pants and dock shoes -- but am debating whether or not to wear socks with my boat shoes. Obviously, these would be dress socks of various brown shades, but are the entirely necessary? If it helps, the job will be in Tampa, Florida, and I am worried about looking presentable in the exreme heat. Thanks for your help, and your tireless efforts for gentlemen everywhere.</div>
        <div class="body"><p>I occasionally wear boat shoes to the office, which has a very business casual atmosphere. That being said, I never wear socks with them. It&#8217;s not a faux pas to go sockless in the summer, at least in my office (and it&#8217;s a law office). I wouldn&#8217;t do it every day though. Get a nice pair of loafers and some wingtips that you can wear every day and save the boat shoes (the the &#8220;go-to-hell&#8221; pants&#8221;) for casual Friday. </p></div>

        <div class="title">I must have missed something. What exactly &quot;business causal&quot; entail? I recently wore coat and tie to an orientation that called for business casual, while others wore untucked polos. Funny thing is, this is a very prestigious internship!</div>
        <div class="body"><p>Slacks or Khakis, polo or oxford, tie optional, always tucked in. Dress shoes, loafers, or boat shoes, matching belt. </p></div>

        <div class="title">Enough about the &quot;business casual&quot; nonsense. Let&#039;s get to a much more important topic: hosting a summer barbeque. What is the proper type of invite, the menu, and the drinks? One must always strive to be a great host for parties and get-together&#039;s.</div>
        <div class="body"><p>Any type of invite, from the mass text message to hand written cards works well. People just want an excuse to come over and be social. Trust me I&#8217;ve already grilled out twice this week, a simple text or call works fine. Drinks should be as simple as beer and light cocktails (gin and tonic is my favorite summer drink), the menu should be tailored to what your guests want. Have guests bring a dish to share if they like. Grill asparagus, corn, burgers, dogs, brats, steak, chicken. Really anything with a char on it from the grill will please. Remember, it isn&#8217;t really grilling if you don&#8217;t have a drink in one hand. </p></div>

In August I will be walking 60 miles in 3 days as part of the Susan G. Komen 3-Day for the Cure raising awareness and money for breast cancer research. I strive everyday to be the best Gentleman I can, I have just finished my freshman year of college, applying your advice to my day to day life. Lesson 61 is something I live every day trying to fulfill. In order to walk I need to raise $2,300. This number is nothing other than a minimum amount. This is my first walk and I am learning about fundraising through it, I am sending letters to family and friends, as well as reaching out to my fraternity brothers and other friends at school for donations. I know this is not something you have done in the past, but I will give you the information necessary for supporting me and let you do with it what you would like. You can donate to me at www.the3day.org/goto/bros4boobies . What are your thoughts on fundraising and the use of the internet in fundraising efforts?<br />

Thank You for Your Help,<br />

        <div class="title">Dear AG,<br />
<br />
My father and I have been having a debate about inseams when it comes to khakis.  I&#039;m around 5&#039;9&#039;&#039; and I usually buy khakis with an inseam of 30 so that not too much of my ankle is showing. Just enough so that if i&#039;m wearing socks, they are somewhat visible. My father thinks that my inseam should be around a 32 so that no sock is showing at all. What is your take on it?</div>
        <div class="body"><p>To be honest you&#8217;re both &#8220;right.&#8221; Where your pants hit your shoes is called the break in your pants. There can be no break, very little or a larger break. Your break should be something you feel makes you look best. I like little or no break in my pants (much like you) while your father seems to like a little more. Go with what looks best and feels most comfortable. </p></div>

<br />
How do you dispel a clouded mind and set yourself straight when full of doubt?</div>
        <div class="body"><p><span>I usually go for a run to clear my head. If that doesn&#8217;t work, stop and reassess what you&#8217;re doing. Examine what is giving you doubts and know that you have the skill, ability and confidence to persevere. </span></p></div>

        <div class="title">I was taught that it&#039;s proper for an older person to extend a handshake to a younger person and that if a man of woman are roughly the same age, the man waits for the woman to extend a handshake. I have encountered numerous situations where it&#039;s obvious that the woman want to extend the handshake but is either waiting for me to extend a handshake first, or is too insecure to stick her hand out first.<br />
In this rapidly changing world, is it now not considered a breach of etiquette for a man to extend a handshake to a woman?</div>
        <div class="body"><p>I have always been of the opinion that you should extend your hand first. It exudes confidence and a demeanor that you are in charge of the situation. When extending your hand to lady, if it&#8217;s a social situation turn the hand slightly as if you were going to kiss it, if business, shake her hand just like anyone else. I know many people will disagree with this stance, but trust me. The simple little turn of her hand will make her remember you. </p></div>

        <div class="title">Lesson No. 125: Hand Written Correspondence is Required.</div>
        <div class="body"><p>In an age of twitter, email and text, never underestimate the power of a hand written note. Tweets disappear in seconds, emails can be easily deleted and texts ignored. Nobody can forget the man (or woman) who personally takes the time to hand write their thank you notes. Every gift, interview, lunch, dinner or networking opportunity you find yourself faced with can be capped off with a hand written thank you. This is not optional, this is required. Find a nice stationary and sign your own name. It will go a long way. </p>

        <div class="title">I know you&#039;ve been saying that you&#039;re going to publish a list of classic novels, but with summer coming to an end.  I was hoping that you would be able to just list a few that you would suggest to read before school starts up again?  Thanks</div>
        <div class="body"><p>I knew I was forgetting something. Okay here&#8217;s a quick 3.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Things They Carried&#8221; by Tim O&#8217;Brien. A great book about an infantry platoon in Vietnam.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Sun Also Rises&#8221; by Ernest Hemingway. Boxing, Bull fights, unrequited love and lots of wine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Women&#8221; by Charles Bukowski. You just have to read Bukowski, there&#8217;s no two ways around it.</p>
<p>Those are three books I have worn out reading time and time again. </p>
<p>Bonus: Go re-read The Great Gatsby. You didn&#8217;t understand it completely in high school, but you will now and you&#8217;ll appreciate it all the more. </p></div>

        <div class="title">So I noticed your comment saying the re-read The Great Gatsby because you didn&#039;t completely understand it in high school.  I find this insulting the intelligence towards me and my feels peers.  I as well as many other feel we have an excellent grasp of the story and its many metaphors and hidden meanings.  As well as the ideal gentlemanly characteristics displayed through out the story from multiple characters.</div>
        <div class="body"><p>Given the errors in grammar, syntax, and spelling, I suggest you read it two, maybe three times. </p>
<p>Remember to read (and spell check) what you write before you send it in. &#8220;It&#8217;s better to remain quiet and be thought a fool, than open your mouth and remove all doubt&#8221; - Mark Twain</p></div>

        <div class="body"><p>Knowing your way around the grill is one thing, but knowing your way around the kitchen is the surefire way to impress any guest, especially a lady. Breakfast is my specialty. </p>
<p>Learning to cook becomes especially handy for large celebrations. Cooking the Thanksgiving or Easter dinner is a job for a man. Doing it well is the task of a gentleman. </p>
<p><img height="566" width="468" src="http://wholesomegal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/retro_man_cooking.jpg" align="middle"/></p>
<p>Learn a handful of recipes that are simple and tasty. Keep it simple, aim for healthy and remember, cooking can be trial and error, but once you have it down, it is certainly impressive. Especially if she&#8217;s still there the next morning. </p></div>

        <div class="title">Lesson No. 127: Never Be Complacent.</div>
        <div class="body"><p>One of the best pieces of advice I ever received, came from a high school football coach. Now I wasn&#8217;t the most talented, athletic or strongest guy on the field. I was average, probably below average, and everyone knew it. The linebacker coach pulled me aside one day and grabbed me by the face mask and said, &#8220;Never be complacent.&#8221; </p>
<p>That advice stuck with me through my entire life. It motivated me through college and into law school and beyond. It is the single most important piece of advice I have ever received. The moment you get complacent is the moment success passes you by. </p>
<p><img align="middle" src="http://www.militaryphotos.net/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=156090&amp;d=1305168709" width="604" height="453"/></p>
<p>This idea is so important that &#8220;Complacency Kills&#8221; has become the official mantra of the GI&#8217;s in Iraq. Signs are posted everywhere reminding them that if you are complacent people will be harmed. </p>
<p>In life you&#8217;re either moving forward or moving backward, nobody stays the same. Make a concerted effort to never be moving backwards. Strive to make yourself better, even if it is just something small, every single day. Never be complacent. </p></div>

        <div class="title">Fall Essentials: The Battle Flag Tee</div>
        <div class="body"><p>I rarely wear t-shirts outside of the gym or on the water. Buffalo and Co. Battle Flag tees are quickly becoming the type of t-shirt I could wear almost anywhere. They make for great casual wear. </p>
<p><img align="middle" src="http://cache0.bigcartel.com/product_images/41285733/fortmoultrie-01745.jpg" width="425" height="500"/></p>
<p>The t-shirt is a exceptionally soft 100% cotton with a great &#8220;frocket&#8221; that features the Buffalo and Company name and logo. The shirts feel durable enough to withstand the backwoods or the surf, yet soft enough that your girlfriend would beg to borrow one on a lazy afternoon.</p>
<p><img height="500" width="425" src="http://cache0.bigcartel.com/product_images/36899682/joinordie-00553.jpg" align="middle"/></p>
<p>The back is where the action is.  Each t-shirt features a famous &#8220;battle flag&#8221; from America&#8217;s history. These shirts are a great way to remember our history and celebrate America, while looking sharp and keeping it casual. </p>
<p><img height="425" width="500" src="http://cache0.bigcartel.com/product_images/39199403/battleflag3-01302.jpg" align="middle"/></p>

<p>Each t-shirt tells a different story of a different flag and a different time in America&#8217;s history where freedom was put on the line. Where freedom was risked and won and these flags united a people, before there was the Stars and Stripes. </p>

        <div class="title">Belle of the Ball Presents: 5 Ways to Impress a Lady on a First Date</div>
        <div class="body"><p class="MsoNormal"><em>Belle of the Ball is a new featured column we will be running in coordination with Chelsea at<a target="_self" href="http://southerngentgifts.tumblr.com/"> Southern Gent Gifts</a>, our resident Belle of the Ball. Be sure to check them out for great gift ideas for yourself or someone special.</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em> </em><span> </span>So often I hear men say that they&#8217;ve been on hundreds of first dates, but very few second dates. It&#8217;s no mystery that a first date can be a nerve wracking experience. It is also very easy to screw up. But fear not Gentlemen, with these five easy steps you will be on your way to a second date in no time. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><img height="431" width="350" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2009/12/2009-12-10_1715.png" align="middle"/><br/></strong><br/><span><span><strong><em><span>First and foremost CALL AND HAVE A PLAN </span></em></strong></span><span> </span><span> </span><br/></span><span><span><span> </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span><span>I understand that it is so much easier to text “let’s hangout Wednesday” BUT that gives a girl no direction. When you make the decision that you would like to spend time with us here are a few KEY things that should be remembered. </span></span></span><span><br/></span></p>
<ul><li>CALL- pick up the phone and call the lady you are interested in seeing, this is a small gesture that we all appreciate. A call can be nerve wracking for some, but if you don&#8217;t have the guts to call her, how do you plan to sit through an entire date&#8217;s worth of conversation? Always call!</li>
<li>DATE AND TIME- Let the girl know a date and time of the actual date. This is key for many aspects from attire to scheduling. She needs to know if you&#8217;re going out at night, if it&#8217;s a casual dinner or if you&#8217;re going to the symphony. Planning is important, a first date is not the best time for spontaneity. </li>
<li>RESERVATIONS - If possible make reservations. Do not show up with no plan in mind. We want to spend time with you, so make life easier by planning ahead with reservations. A woman is impressed when you can walk in, simply say your name, and be led to a table for two. </li>
</ul><p><span><br/></span><span><span><strong><em><span>Second, DON’T FORGET SIMPLE GESTURES. </span></em></strong></span><span></span><span></span><br/></span><span><span><span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span><span>Pick the lady up at her place and come to the door. Do not wait in your car. If we are running late don&#8217;t worry, remember, we are trying to impress you and have taken the time to do so. Three simple gestures that you can make that will go a long way are:</span></span></span><span><br/></span></p>
<ul><li>Open the car door.  </li>
<li>Open the door at the restaurant. </li>
<li>Pull out her chair. </li>
</ul><p><img height="350" width="365" src="http://www.tsbmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/second1.jpg" align="middle"/></p>
<ul></ul><p><span><span><span>These simple things may not seem like much, but growing up most of us have seen our dads perform these simple gestures daily with our mothers. Old school, classic, and shows respect. </span></span></span><span><br/><br/></span><span><span><strong><em><span>Third, KEEP THE CONVERSATION ON A POSITIVE NOTE. </span></em></strong></span><span></span><span></span><br/></span><span><span><span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span><span>You may be having tons of problems. You may HATE your job,may be failing a class, in a fight with your parents, arguing with your roommate, you feel broke, your ex is evil, or all of the above. And yes we are willing to listen, but we agreed to a DATE. We agreed to spend time with you because we want to get to know you. We do not want to be your psychiatrist, especially when trying to have a good time. If you can&#8217;t think of anything to say, or are having an off day, or even really want to impress us, ask questions! The easiest way to strike up a conversation with anyone, especially a woman on the first date is to ask her questions. But be careful to keep the questions grounded a bit, don&#8217;t ask her if she plans to have kids or when she wants to get married. Save those for date 197, not date number 1. </span></span></span><span><br/></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><br/></span><span><span><strong><em><span>Fourth, CASUALLY PAY WITHOUT US NOTICING. </span></em></strong></span></span><span><br/></span><span><span><span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span><span>There is nothing more awkward than the check sitting on the table between us staring us in the face. Even if you are going to pay and planning on it, at that moment we are debating whether we should offer or if we even brought cash or cards. Before the check arrives, slip off to the bathroom or to the bar for after dinner drinks, grab the waiter or a hostess, slip her your credit card and pay the bill. That way when the check comes back, it is already taken care of and awkward moment avoided. </span></span></span><span><br/><br/></span><span><span><strong><em><span></span></em></strong></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span><strong><em><span>Fifth and FINALLY, FINISH THE DATE.</span></em></strong></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span><strong><em><span></span></em></strong></span></span>Even if you plan on going out after, make sure to close the date. Take us home, tell us you had a great time. It&#8217;s always difficult to know what to do after dinner, whether you take her out with your friends or go grab after dinner drinks. Even so, make sure that we get home okay. MOST importantly - call the next day and tell us thank you. If you don’t see a future, a simple text is fine. Just remember to end on a good note because even if nothing happens in the future, it is better to be known as a Gentleman than a jerk. Girls talk, it will get around that you were not courteous and respectful.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img height="374" width="480" src="http://www.worldsfamousphotos.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/robert_doisneau_le_baiser_de_lhotel_de_ville_kiss_at_the_hotel.jpg" align="middle"/></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Follow these five simple rules and you will be will on your way to a second date. What you do from there is up to you. Remember always be a gentleman and keep it classy.  - c<strong>H</strong>c</p></div>

        <div class="title">I have a long-distance girlfriend who is very attractive and receives a lot of attention from other guys at her college. They all know we are dating, and she doesn&#039;t give them the time of day or any reason for them to pursue her, yet they continually do. I have spoken with several of these guys in person and via text message, trying to make them understand they need to back off or there will be consequences, yet my threats do not dissuade them given my geological location. Please keep in mind that none of these men would be considered gentlemen in the least. Do you have any advice as to how I should go about handling this situation?</div>
        <div class="body"><p><span>I&#8217;ve been there, I get it. It&#8217;s a really tricky situation, long-distance relationships are tough enough to begin with. We all know you have to completely trust the other person when you are not near the one you are dating&#8230;. but throwing in guys pursuing her is a whole different ball game.<br/>One one hand, it&#8217;s nice to know she is wanted by other people, because well, you got her. On the other, you feel helpless and that feeling just sucks. I would say to ignore it and hope it goes away, but it won&#8217;t. The worst thing you can do is get upset with her about it because it will push her out of your arms and into theirs. Be confident. Show up on un-announced visits to surprise her, send letters, flowers etc. Everyone knows she is yours already, but a few extra things can&#8217;t hurt. Make sure you keep your focus on her when you do talk to her though. If you spend too much time complaining about other people she can get annoyed, especially because she does nothing to bring on these pursuits. <br/>Best thing I can tell you is take it as a compliment someone would fight so hard for her. But be confident in her and your relationship and know that you win the battle every time.<br/></span></p></div>

        <div class="title">Fall Essentials: The Cash Robinson Silks Reserve Polo</div>
        <div class="body"><p>As summer winds down, and the fall is upon us, it&#8217;s time for more essentials. As far as essentials, Gentlemen can find many of their favorites in Kentucky. There&#8217;s plenty to love about Kentucky. My favorite things from Kentucky are made in small batches, Bourbon and Champion Race Horses.  Horse Racing has been called the sport of Gentleman and Kings, and the Kentucky Derby is no exception (I once left a friend&#8217;s wedding ceremony to watch the derby. I wouldn&#8217;t recommend this for the sake of the friendship). At the end of a long day, a nice glass of bourbon (neat or with just a couple rocks) is the perfect way to unwind. Yeah, Kentucky gives us a lot to love.</p>
<p>Now, <a target="_blank" href="http://cashrobinson.com/products.php">Cash Robinson</a> gives us another small batch from Kentucky to love, their Small Batch Silks Reserve Polo. The Small Batch Silks Reserve is made in the vein of Small Batch Kentucky Bourbon, rare and kept in Kentucky cedar. When I opened the package at my front door, I was pleasantly surprised to find my new polo, not in a plastic bag like some coltheirs, but instead, in a locked cedar box</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpsfuohWk61qztw2y.jpg"/></p>
<p>As Cash Robinson tells it, the Silks Reserve celebrates one of the many time-honored traditions of horse racing dating back to the 1700’s in England. The jockey silk is meant to identify and distinguish the jockey and horse from the others during a race. This polo is easily identifiable from the pack. To put it mildly, the polo<span> fits like a dream. It is incredibly soft, yet fitted to an athletic build. It is the type of polo you could wear to the office and then, around lunch, duck out for 18 holes and no-one would be the wiser. </span></p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpsfx2fXBV1qztw2y.jpg"/></p>
<p>The 2011 Spring Silks Reserve features twelve different jockey silk patterns and color combinations. At only $69.50 for one of these rare polos, it seems like a steal for something this classic, timeless and well made. While they have many combinations to choose from, remember they are a small batch, which means they won&#8217;t last forever. These polos are like a fine small batch bourbon indeed. Rare, worth the price, and easy to savor. </p></div>

I know that you prefer fine whiskey neat.  However, as a college student, I don&#039;t always have access to fine whiskey.  So I must ask, what is the gentleman&#039;s choice when it comes to whiskey mixed-drinks?</div>

Remember the names of everyone you meet and shake hands with confidence. There&#8217;s a reason politicians are &#8220;shaking hands and kissing babies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Exchange business cards with anyone who has them. Expand the radius of people who know your name, know what you are about and use this to your advantage. Whether it be socially or in business, the larger the radius, the more successful the gentleman. </p></div>

        <div class="title">Dear AG, I need your advice. My dad used to be an American Gentleman. Now, due to the circumstances of life, his  AG is asleep (or that&#039;s what i like to think).  He still is a gentleman with my mom but it&#039;s like he has forgotten some etiquette basic rules and his style is bad. Can you give any advice of how can I wake up his AG, specially in the clothing matter? Sincerely, K.</div>
        <div class="body"><p>Lead by example in terms of etiquette and politely remind him what he is missing. Joke with him about his fashion, but don&#8217;t be mean. Start small, buy him a couple sport shirts, compliment him when he wears clothes that you think look sharp. Remember style is personal. </p></div>

        <div class="title">Dear AG,  I recently was with a friend when we ran into a sorority girl he knew. I introduced myself and asked her name but did not extend my hand for a handshake, as I am in college and felt it would appear over the top to shake a girl&#039;s hand. I immediately regretted my decision as I noticed her eyes dart to my hand as if waiting for me to extend it. I felt like an un-mannered slob and was wondering your take on introductions with ladies, shake or no shake, and so forth. -An Iowa Gentleman</div>
        <div class="body"><p>It is always polite and proper to shake a woman&#8217;s hand. Introductions with women are the same as introductions with men, make eye contact, shake hands and most importantly remember names. The hardest part of an introduction is remembering someones name. Repeat it in your head three or four times and it will tend to stick. </p></div>

        <div class="body"><p>I have worn for a long time now a Timex with a fabric blue band. I think I paid $30 total for it. Looks sharp enough to wear with a suit or casual enough for every day. </p>

<p>A Gentleman never gives up. Persistence is the key to success. You will be pushed, tested, worn down, lauded over and frustrated in your efforts. Never Quit. Do not just walk away. Fall down 9 times, stand up 10. Nothing worth having ever comes easy. </p>

        <div class="title">Dear AG, what are your thoughts on dress socks? what do you try to match your socks with? Also, is it to in-formal to wear dress socks with a design on the sides of them. Thank you Anonymous</div>
        <div class="body"><p>Usually you match your socks with the color of your trousers/slacks. Unless you&#8217;re wearing khakis in which case you can wear a navy sock or a khaki sock, but usually navy. Designs are fine, socks are like pocket squares, sometimes it&#8217;s fun to punch up your outfit with them. </p>
<p>Dress socks are the only socks I wear (outside of the gym or wool winter socks with boots), otherwise I&#8217;m in boat shoes. You never ever wear socks with boat shoes. </p></div>

        <div class="title">Should a gentleman chase a lady?</div>
        <div class="body"><p>If there is one certainty (aside from death and taxes) it is that women love to be pursued. They will play hard to get, they will try to make you fight for them and work for it and win over their affections. </p>
<p>If you think she&#8217;s worth the chase, then by all means pursue. If you don&#8217;t chase her someone else will. </p>
<p>Also know the difference between &#8220;hard to get&#8221; and &#8220;never gonna get caught.&#8221; Don&#8217;t chase the girl who doesn&#8217;t want to get caught. </p></div>

        <div class="title">Due to my new suit-and-tie career with a prestigious financial institution, I am on a quest for the perfect dress shirt. So far I have struck out due to various details on different brands (some fit poorly, some are too thin and see-through, others have pockets, still others don&#039;t offer French cuffs, etc). What are your favorite makers, or is there a good custom shirtings option you prefer?</div>

        <div class="title">Lesson No. 130: In a Suit, Belts and Dress Shoes are Required.</div>
        <div class="body"><p>I cannot count the number of times I see young men wearing slacks without a belt. To top it off, these same guys usually are the ones wearing tennis shoes with their suits. It is abhorrent (look it up). If there are belt loops on the pants, they require a belt. You are not being ironic (stow it hipster), your tennis shoes are not hip. They are classless and you look like a fool. </p>
<p><img align="middle" src="http://www.thegolfballfactory.com/the-golf-course/hole18/president-kennedy-golfing.jpg" width="305" height="460"/></p>
<p>This is simple. Pull up your pants, put on a belt, shine your dress shoes and join the rest of society as a functional adult. No ironic belt buckles, no big belt buckles at all. If you can&#8217;t play golf in the belt, it&#8217;s the wrong belt. If you&#8217;re not wearing dress shoes, you&#8217;re not getting hired. I thought we covered this stuff in pledgship?! </p></div>

        <div class="title">Lesson No. 131: When People Talk, Listen.</div>
        <div class="body"><p>The major problem we have these days is that nobody listens. We just wait for our turn to talk. We hear the other party, but we are busy thinking of what to say to refute them, what interesting (or not so interesting) topic to talk about next, or how to return the focus to ourselves. </p>
<p><img height="359" width="450" src="http://www.federatedmedia.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/conversation-3.jpeg" align="middle"/></p>
<p>We need to stop. Take a breath. Clear our minds and truly listen to what the other person is telling us. Learn about them from their stories, their opinions, their beliefs. Truly listen to what they have to say. They will respect you more for it, you will know them better because of it. </p></div>

        <div class="title">First I&#039;d like to thank you for all your incredible advice.  It is appreciated more than you can imagine.  I have a question concerning the &quot;unattainable girl&quot;.  The one girl that, even though you can talk and socialize and charm any girl in the world, this one just stops you cold and you lose your words.  If I&#039;m at an &quot;acquaintance&quot; level with her, how can I ask her out if I only see her every so often and in passing?  Thanks AG.</div>
        <div class="body"><p>Call her and ask her out. Simple as that.</p>
<p>I knew my girlfriend and we were great friends for nearly 5 years before our first date. Timing and chemistry make all the difference. </p>
<p>Also a pearl of wisdom from the aforementioned girlfriend: Find ways to be in the same places she is. Not in a  creepy/stalker way. If you see her out say hi every time, no matter if you are  busy or she looks busy. Always walk up to her and say hello. Find little ways to  keep her in your life.</p>
<p>Build on that, start small then hang out with mutual  friends. See her at a game. Ask her out. If she says no, ask her to join a group  activity with you. The more she is around you the more she will appreciate  you. The more she is around you the more she will realize she needs you. Then  one of those times she asks you out- you may get lucky and she&#8217;ll say yes. But  it&#8217;s important to have that friendship to fall back on.</p>
<p>Having her in your life in some aspect and dealing with  small rejections may be better than not having her around at all.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be afraid to take risks. Worst thing she can do is  say no. And while she may say no 2906532789692 times&#8230;. all it takes is 1 yes  for something to start</p></div>

        <div class="title">What is your opinion on long-distance relationships? I have recently begun seeing a woman who I care alot about, but I am moving 16+ hours away to start my new job in two weeks. Can a new relationship survive this? Thanks AG.</div>
        <div class="body"><p>I think they are difficult but these days they&#8217;re do-able. Trust is the most important thing here. If you trust each other you&#8217;ll be fine. Distance is hard, no doubt, I&#8217;ve been there. But it&#8217;s survivable. </p>
<p>Be open, share with her your plans and goals for the relationship. Make sure you trust her and she trusts you. Be faithful and honest and make an effort to keep in contact often. Surprise visits and delivered flowers never hurt either. </p></div>

        <div class="title">Lesson No. 132: Hubris is Not a Supplement for Genuine Confidence.</div>
        <div class="body"><p>The old adage &#8221;fake it till you make it&#8221; doesn&#8217;t apply to us. We are genuinely confident in our abilities. We understand the value of hard work. We are not cocky or flashy, we are calm, centered, focused and determined. As Teddy Roosevelt said, &#8220;<span>Keep your eyes on the stars, and your feet on the ground.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span><img height="380" width="550" src="http://media-1.web.britannica.com/eb-media/16/119416-004-A1B400A5.jpg" align="middle"/><br/></span></p>
<p>Hubris, the appearance of confidence, will not get you anywhere. It is weakness. This is not to say that being optimistic is bad, it is not. Don&#8217;t let naivete and hubris become the outward appearance of confidence. Believe in your abilities, but don&#8217;t brag about them. Actions speak louder than words. There is a fine line between confidence and arrogance. Confidence is the possession of actual ability, arrogance is the outward appearance of such. You can fake it, but you most certainly will not make it. </p></div>

        <div class="body"><p>Traditionally it was your left arm (to keep your right arm free for your sword or dueling pistol), over time it evolved to today&#8217;s standard: Stand on the side of her which is closest to the street, between her and the curb. The idea here is that oncoming traffic may spray water, jump the curb, etc. </p></div>

        <div class="title">Lesson No. 133: Notice the Little Things.</div>
        <div class="body"><p>Sweat the small stuff, be keenly aware of the little things. Being observant can be one of your most important assets. For instance, the office receptionist had a new hair cut. One small comment about it, and her day was made. Details matter. The fine print of life is important.</p>
<p><img align="middle" src="http://www.mosaictelecom.com/~jfox3/Newsboy%20bottle%2001.jpg" width="438" height="329"/> </p>
<p>Noticing the little things can be the difference between making a sale, closing a deal, making someone&#8217;s day, making a difference, or simply being forgotten. Make sure to pay attention to details. Give the small compliment. Hold open doors. Notice and fix the little mistakes. Celebrate the little victories. Don&#8217;t ignore the small stuff. Sweat it. </p></div>

        <div class="title">Re: Holly Golightly  Dear AG, As a lady I am slightly concerned that you would use an image of Holly Golightly to represent us. While Ms. Hepburn is certainly a lady, her American geisha character certainly is not. That being said, the little black dress is an essential tool in the wardrobe of any lady. I have not qualms with your conclusion, but in the future, please choose your examples more carefully. I would hate to be confused with Holly on a first date.</div>

        <div class="title">Is bringing a plus one to a wedding a necessity?</div>
        <div class="body"><p>No. You only take a &#8220;plus one&#8221; if you are given one by the bride and groom. Otherwise you don&#8217;t bring anyone else. If you do get one, you could bring a date, but you don&#8217;t have to. There&#8217;s absolutely no downside to bringing a date to a wedding, in my personal experience.  </p></div>

        <div class="title">I&#039;m a girl in college, and I&#039;ve recently started seeing a guy. He&#039;s very polite and thoughtful, but almost to the point that it seems like an act or that he does this for &quot;all the girls.&quot; Any suggestions on how to tell if this is just a routine and he&#039;s a smooth talker or if he is genuinely interested? Thanks!</div>
        <div class="body"><p>If he acts like he does this with &#8220;all the girls&#8221; it may very well be an act, or more likely, a defense mechanism. Talk to him, be open and ask about him. Get to know who he really is. A lot of people put on an act in front of crowds, you&#8217;re dating him though so you have the opportunity to learn who he really is. If he&#8217;s seeing you, he&#8217;s interested, don&#8217;t worry about the act. Just try to get to know who he really is and let him be himself. </p></div>

        <div class="title">Lesson No. 134: Be Confident in Who You Are.</div>
        <div class="body"><p>Make the choices that fit you best. Being a gentleman is about character and a lifestyle not about the clothes you wear or the brands you buy. It&#8217;s not what you wear, but how you wear it. Carry yourself with confidence, be a man of the utmost character. </p>
<p>Strive to be the Gentleman that mother&#8217;s love and father&#8217;s hope for their future son-in-law. When you look back in 10 or 15 years you want to have looked the way you acted. Classy and respectable. </p>

Everyone can buy &#8220;stuff&#8221; but it&#8217;s the memories and joy that a thoughtful, creative gift brings that really last. I say get creative. </p></div>

        <div class="title">A.G., I am a Junior in college and thinking about investing in a class ring, however one of your former lessons that said &#039;only wedding bands&#039; is ringing in the back of my head. Exception or not? Thanks in advance.</div>
        <div class="body"><p>I don&#8217;t wear jewelry and class rings were a very &#8220;high school&#8221; sort of thing. I think the framed degree on the office wall speaks to your accomplishments, a college class ring speaks of pretentiousness.</p></div>

        <div class="title">Dear AG, Any tips for building self confidence?</div>
        <div class="body"><p>Have a genuine belief in your ability to succeed. Work out and get in shape, learn a new language or talent, learn public speaking skills, talk to strangers often. Learn to like yourself. If you don&#8217;t like something about yourself, make a concerted effort to change it. Smile more often. Stand up straight. Put your shoulders back and keep your head up. Little things like this will show people that you are confident, which in turn builds more confidence. Best way I&#8217;ve learned to build confidence is to fake it till you make it. </p></div>

        <div class="title">I am in the market to buy my first nice watch, and my price range is 3-5 thousand. What do you recommend? Thanks.</div>
        <div class="body"><p>Invest the money in something a little more realistic. I picked up a sharp looking watch for $15 at an auction and got complimented by a senior partner on it. Don&#8217;t be stupid with money, that&#8217;s my recommendation. </p></div>

        <div class="title">Do you ever get tired of getting questions about dealing with breakups, heartache, talking to girls, and insecurities?</div>
        <div class="body"><p>You haven&#8217;t the slightest clue my friend, I also tire of arrogance that poses as confidence, hubris, people who talk about money, and people who are so disingenuous it makes it difficult to take them seriously. </p></div>
